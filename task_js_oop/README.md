# Kottans Front-End Course

## Object-Oriented JavaScript

### Frogger - [demo](https://kurosavaakira.github.io/kottans-frontend/task_js_oop/frogger)

In this task the most difficult part was to understand how the arcade game Frogger works and to write appropriate code for it to finish the game. I learned how to use inheritance and how works collision detection.

Also, codewars site is cool. I'm planning to master above 7 kata in near future.
